<h1>On-premises Active Directory Deployed in the Cloud (Azure)</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab, we'll create two VMs in the same VNETâ€”one as a Domain Controller (DC) with a static IP offering Active Directory services, and the other as a Client machine. The client will join the domain, and its DNS settings will be configured to use the DC as the primary DNS server. The project involves establishing an Active Directory system for centralized user credential oversight and network traffic management. By routing all internet traffic through the main server (Active Directory) via organization devices (Clients), administrators can monitor network activity and detect suspicious logs. Additionally, the project includes a PowerShell script to generate 1,000 users and showcases a device within the organization's domain, ensuring efficient management of user credentials and network traffic.

<h2>Step 1: Setup</h2>

First, using Azure, create a Resource Group. Now, create 2 Virtual Machines(VMs). One will be the Domain Controller and the other will be the Client. To create the Domain Controller, give the VM a name as well as assign it to the Resource Group created before.

Now for the image use Windows Server 2022. It is recommended for the size to use 2 vcpus.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/FNoA7m0.png" height="70%" width="70%" alt="9"/><br />

Give the admin log in credentials that can be remembered or just write them down in notepad. Now, click "Next" until reaching the "Networking" tab. Take note of the "Virtual Network" created. This will be important when creating the Client VM. Check the box under Licensing then "Review and create" the VM.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/NxXFK16.png" height="70%" width="70%" alt="9"/><br />

Now, create the Client VM. Same thing as the first one except the image should be using Windows 10.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/2PvUCJN.png" height="70%" width="70%" alt="9"/><br />

Click, Next until reaching the Networking tab. Make sure the Virtual Network is the same as the Domain Controller. Now Review and create.

Now it's time to set the Domain Controller's NIC Private IP to static. Go to the Domain Controller and click on the "Networking" tab. Next, click on the "Network Interface."

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/6W2WZTA.png" height="60%" width="60%" alt="9"/><br />

Now, go the "IP configurations" tab and click on the IP configuration. 

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/0R53K7r.png" height="60%" width="60%" alt="9"/><br />

Now, change the Allocation from "Dynamic" to "Static." Then click Save.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/JAGBZtk.png" height="60%" width="60%" alt="9"/><br />

Now, using the user and password created before, login to the Client with it's IP address in Remote Desktop Connection. 

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/28TrmKg.png" height="55%" width="55%" alt="9"/><br />

Now, using Command Prompt, ping the Domain Controller with it's Private IP Address. Type in "ping (Your DC Private IP) -t" to perpetually ping. For now it will time out.

```commandline
ping 10.0.0.4 -t
```

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/1zyrIUN.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="9"/><br />

Next its time to enable ICMPv4. First, login to the Domain Controller VM then open "Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security" 

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/bYkAEwk.png" height="85%" width="85%" alt="9"/><br />

Click on "Inbound Rules" and Sort by "Protocol". Look for the rules with "Core Networking Diagnostics - ICMP Echo Request(ICMPv4-In)" There will be two of them (Both on the bottom of the image below)

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/EydkpVV.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="9"/><br />

Right-click and Enable both rules. Now go back to the Client VM and check on the command prompt. It should now be properly pinging the Domain Controller.

Next, copy and paste the script from this link into the text editor. 

https://github.com/joshmadakor1/AD_PS/blob/master/Generate-Names-Create-Users.ps1

Choose "1_CREATE_USERS.ps1".

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/m6N6m4j.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="9"/><br />

Run "Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted" in the command line.

```commandline
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
```

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/xCzIjyZ.png" height="65%" width="65%" alt="9"/><br />

Change directory to script.

```commandline
cd C:\Users\tsmith\Desktop\1_CREATE_USERS.psy
```

Now, click the Run button to run the script. This will start creating domain users with usernames and passwords (The Password for these users will be "Password1") Example below:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/IN8xvda.png" height="65%" width="65%" alt="9"/><br />
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/RMyC0Co.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="9"/><br />

Go to Server Manager>Tools>Active Directory Users and Computers. Under the "_EMPLOYEES" tab, look at all of the users created from the script.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/f2xPlao.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="9"/><br />

These names are all randomly generated. Choose one and log into the Client VM with the username it is assigned. (Remember the password is "Password1)
